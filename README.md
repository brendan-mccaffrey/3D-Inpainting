# 3D-Inpainting

This is an application that generates 3D Photography from 2D images using context-aware layered depth inpainting. This repository is based of prior [research](https://shihmengli.github.io/3D-Photo-Inpainting/) which I do not take credit for. The code is based off an adapted Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mrm8488/shared_colab_notebooks/blob/master/3D_Photo_Inpainting_multiple_download.ipynb#scrollTo=IY-s3ZpHBeAU) by [Manu Romero](https://twitter.com/mrm8488)

## Goal

Create a Python API using Flask to generate 3D photos from 2D images.

## Future

- [ ] Add a front-end to the API
- [ ] Add a database to store images
- [ ] Integrate web3 login and auto-minting of resulting photos as NFTs
- [ ] Create a mobile UI for the API
